# Image Processing with OpenCV üñºÔ∏è

This project is an image processing project using the OpenCV library and written in C++. It is built using CMake.

The project is intended for use in a university setting and is not being developed. However,
feel free to use and modify the code for your own educational purposes.

The project contains two main folders:

1. Watermarking_images: This folder contains the code for the image watermarking functionality.
2. Pencil_Sketch: This folder contains the code for the pencil sketch effect functionality.

### Requirements üß∞ 

- OpenCV
- CMake
- C++ compiler
